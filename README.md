# RandomPlugins
Random Spigot plugins to show my skills and also to improve them.

## Building

> **NOTE:** This plugins were made with IntelliJ IDEA as IDE, so this part might be a bit different with others IDEs.

To compile every single project inside here, you'll need to add a Run Configuration.

This can be done at **Run > Edit Configurations...**. You'll need to press the **+** button and click **Maven**.

On **Working Directory** you'll need to click the little **folder icon** on the right side and **select your project root folder** (RandomPlugins), then on **Command Line** you'll need to **write ```clean install```**.

You can check the box that states to make a single instance so it only run once at a time.

Moreover, you can edit the configuration name if you want.

Lastly you should click **OK** to save the configuration.

Make sure that your new configuration is selected and click the **Run button** to compile every project in this repository.
